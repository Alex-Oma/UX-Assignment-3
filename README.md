# UX-Assignment-3 Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of responsive HTML5 web pages which implement three Figma wireframes I've created for my UX assigment.
The web pages are meant to work seamlessly across dekstop, mobile and tablet devices of all sizes. 
The goal of this project is to learn how to transform wireframes into responsive front-end user interface using HTML5, CSS3, and frameworks.
In addition to that this project focuses on information architecture, uses GitHub for version control and GitHub Pages for deployment.
For this project I've used Bootstrap framework.

## What This Project Does

- Contains three responsive HTML5 pages which implement 3 user stories and index.html page for navigation.
- Contains shared styles.css file with custom styles shared across all three pages.
- Uses Bootstrap framework (https://getbootstrap.com/) to implement layout responsiveness.
- Uses semantic HTML5 tags like <header>, <footer>, <main>, <article>, <section> in order to enhance accessibility and make the pages ready for search engine optimisation.

## User Stories

The three pages I've created implement three user stories I've come up with in the UX Assignment 2 and are meant to offer users three valuable features on the coffeeshop website such as:
- store locator page;
- order summary page;
- order delivery options page.
